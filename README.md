LaserDisc is a(nother) Scala driver for [Redis](https://redis.io/), written in Scala from the ground up.

It differentiates itself from the others for having a core layer, which is made up of all the supported Redis commands
and the Redis Serialization Protocol ([RESP](https://redis.io/topics/protocol)), that is strongly typed and which makes
heavy use of [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) and [refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined) to
achieve this. It's also worth noting that the core - in order to be built - makes use of
[Typelevel's Scala 2.12](https://typelevel.org/scala) fork, since it requires the enhancements on implicit heuristics
and the surfacing of literal types. Finally, it also provides an implementation of RESP built using
[scodec](http://scodec.org/).

On top of this, one or more clients can be implemented. The only one currently available out of the box is built using
[fs2](https://functional-streams-for-scala.github.io/fs2/)/[cats effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) but
more competing implementations can be added with limited effort. This implementation has found great inspiration from
the excellent [fs2-kafka](https://github.com/Spinoco/fs2-kafka/) library.

### *Disclaimer*

:warning: Development is very much early stages and subject to frequent and breaking changes. :warning:

What's there:
- [x] Codecs for Redis' RESP wire format
- [x] Fully-fledged protocol encapsulating request/response pairs for (almost) all Redis [commands](https://redis.io/commands)
- [x] Initial version of single-node Redis client. Lots of improvements needed
- [x] Minimal CLI

What's missing:
- [ ] Everything else :)

### Why the name

Two reasons:
1. "A LaserDisc" is an anagram for "Scala Redis"
2. LaserDiscs were invented in 1978 (same year I was born) and were so cool (and foundational, more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc))

### Getting Started

LaserDisc is currently available for Scala 2.11 and 2.12 on the JVM.

Its core (protocol commands and RESP wire format) is also available for [Scala.JS](http://www.scala-js.org/).

To add LaserDisc as a dependency to your project just add the following to your `build.sbt`:
```
libraryDependencies += "io.laserdisc" %% "laserdisc-fs2" % latestVersion
```

If you only need protocols (i.e. Redis commands and RESP wire format), you may simply add:
```
libraryDependencies += "io.laserdisc" %% "laserdisc-core" % latestVersion
```

### Example usage
With a running Redis instance on `localhost:6379` try running the following:
```scala
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup
import java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool

import cats.effect.IO
import cats.syntax.apply._
import fs2.{Scheduler, Stream, StreamApp}
import laserdisc._
import laserdisc.auto._
import laserdisc.fs2._

import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

object Main extends StreamApp[IO] {

  implicit final val ec: ExecutionContext          = ExecutionContext.global
  implicit final val asg: AsynchronousChannelGroup = AsynchronousChannelGroup.withThreadPool(newFixedThreadPool(2))
  implicit final val logger: Logger[IO]            = new Logger[IO] {
    override def log(level: Logger.Level, msg: => String, maybeT: Logger.MaybeT): IO[Unit] = IO {
      println(s">>> $msg")
    }
  }

  override final def stream(args: List[String], requestShutdown: IO[Unit]): Stream[IO, StreamApp.ExitCode] =
    Scheduler[IO](corePoolSize = 1).flatMap { implicit scheduler =>
      RedisClient[IO](Set(RedisAddress("localhost", 6379))).evalMap { client =>
        client.send2(string.set("a", 23), string.get[PosInt]("a")).flatMap {
          case (Right("OK"), Right(Some(getResponse))) if getResponse.value == 23 => logger.info("yay!") *> IO.pure(StreamApp.ExitCode.Success)
          case other => logger.error(s"something went terribly wrong $other") *> IO.raiseError(new RuntimeException("boom"))
        }
      }
    }
    .onFinalize(IO(asg.shutdown))
}
```

This should produce the following output:
```bash
>>> Starting connection
>>> Server available for publishing: localhost:6379
>>> sending Array(BulkString(SET),BulkString(a),BulkString(23))
>>> receiving SimpleString(OK)
>>> sending Array(BulkString(GET),BulkString(a))
>>> receiving BulkString(23)
>>> yay!
>>> Shutting down connection
>>> Connection terminated: Left(java.nio.channels.ShutdownChannelGroupException)
```
